I would like to thank Cyril Jacquier, original author of fail2ban, for
accepting me into the team, back when fail2ban stopped working because of
Python version bumps everywhere.

Then to Yaroslav Halchenko, who has an amazing love for fail2ban and the
people around it. He always has a :) in his replies. You are awesome, man.

And finally, to Harrison Johnson, for jumping on the fail2ban-cluster wagon
and being the first contributor and first tester.

THANK YOU ALL.

Live long and prosper.


Buanzo.
