Welcome to the first release of fail2ban-zmq-tools, also known as
fail2ban-cluster.

I, buanzo, am running the fail2ban-publisher on f2bcluster.buanzo.org
You will need to mail me (buanzo@buanzo.com.ar) to obtain a TOKEN (see
fail2ban-cluster.conf for token configuration for [monitor]).

If you rather run your own Publisher instance, just create a token, and
configure it on your fail2ban-cluster.conf [publisher] section, then use
that token in every Monitor configuration.
